Chest X-Ray COVID-19 Classification
This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images to identify COVID-19 cases using deep learning. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this application helps in distinguishing between Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19 categories, providing a potential tool to support medical diagnostics.

The dataset is available at: [COVID-19 Radiography Database on Kaggle](https://github.com/brainmentorsblogs/data_science/blob/main/CovidCNN_XrayClassification.ipynb)
