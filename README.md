Chest X-Ray COVID-19 Classification <br>
This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images to identify COVID-19 cases using deep learning. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this application helps in distinguishing between Normal and COVID-19 categories, providing a potential tool to support medical diagnostics.
